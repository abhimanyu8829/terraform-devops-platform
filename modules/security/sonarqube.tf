/*
Purpose: Module placeholder for SonarQube deployment and configuration.

How to use:
- Replace this placeholder with resources required to deploy SonarQube (VMs, containers, or managed service) and related configuration.
- Expose inputs via variables (e.g., admin_password) and obtain secrets from secure sources.

What to change:
- Implement the actual deployment resources and remove the placeholder `null_resource`.
